[mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)  is awesome tool to publish your books online. It offers five themes 
- Light
- Ayu
- Navy
- Coal
- Rust

They are all great but if you are an individual publisher, it gets hard to test your published work in five different themes . Given a multitude of browser/device combinations, it is a lot of work for a single writer to review her work in five different typographies and to fine-tune them to suit the needs of the publication. Too much choice :-)

Yellow theme, makes all the theme choices point to a single theme with yellow `#f9ce00` back-ground, with black `Kalam` fonts from `Indian Type Foundry`. Fonts are available for free download or direct embed at [google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kalam?query=Indian+Type+Foundry&noto.script=Deva)

The `Kalam` fonts are hybrid of a normal and italics. A carefree font that is good for both English and Hindi â€” particularly so if you have a mix of both in your publication. Very suitable for poetic quotes common to most of the books !
